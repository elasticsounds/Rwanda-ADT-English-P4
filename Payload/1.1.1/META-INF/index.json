The Rwandan educational philosophy is to ensure that you achieve full potential at every level of education which will prepare all learners to be well integrated in society and exploit employment opportunities. Among factors that affect the delivery of competence-based curriculum include shortage of engaging, motivating and inclusive instructional materials to be used by learners with and without disabilities in the classroom. In competence-based curriculum, learning is considered as a process of active building and developing knowledge and meanings by the learner where concepts are mainly introduced by an activity, a situation or a scenario that helps the learner to construct knowledge, develop skills and acquire positive attitudes and values. The digital textbook complements the curriculum-aligned textbooks. The government of Rwanda emphasizes the importance of supporting teaching and learning materials to facilitate your learning process for learners.  Many factors influence what you learn but more attention should be on improving the classroom learning environment to ensure that learners with and without disability are learning in accordance to their learning preferences. For effective use of this digital learning materials, your role is to ensure that this digital learning materials are used to supplement other materials in the classroom, assistive tools needed by learners with disability are available and installed on devices and learners facilitated by instructors on how to use them during learning.  I wish to sincerely extend my appreciation to the people who contributed towards the development of this Accessible and Interactive Multimedia Textbooks, particularly REB staff who organized and provided required technical support to the whole process. Special gratitude goes to REB in-house multidisciplinary team consisted of sign language Interpreters, audio narrators and instructional designers who carefully worked to successful completion of this textbooks. Any comment or contribution would be welcome for the improvement of this textbook for the next edition.   Dr. MBARUSHIMANA Nelson  Director General of Rwanda Basic Education Board\nii",

Every day they met under an old mango tree at the end of the forest. They would spend hours talking about the latest news about where they lived. The dog would tell the wolf what was happening on his master’s farm and the wolf told the dog all the news of the forest. One day the wolf said to the dog, ‘Listen, my friend, I hear that your master’s cat has given birth to little kittens.’ ‘That’s true. Just think! Six little kittens in the house. And all of them are so fat and pretty!’ ‘You are making me hungry by just talking about it,’ said the wolf. The wolf wanted to eat the kittens. ‘I must go and see them tonight.’ ‘No, my friend, don’t do that,’ said the dog. ‘We agreed that we would meet here, and that I would tell you all the news, but you will never come to my master’s farm.

But you are my friend. You will be loyal to me.’ ‘That’s easy enough for you to say. But don’t forget that my master is also my friend. He looks after me and gives me food. How can I be disloyal to him? What will he think of me?’\nThat’s your problem,’ said the wolf. ‘I must have the kittens for my supper tonight, so take my advice and be quiet about it.’ Night came and the wolf kept his word.
